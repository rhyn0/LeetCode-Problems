        Balloons are defined by a start edge and end edge on an axis.
        Arrows pop all balloons above a certain point on that axis.

        By sorting the end edge of balloons in the array, can guarantee
        that all edges after current are greater than or equal to current.
        Then as long as the start edge of the next one is less than current end edge
        there exists an overlap point between current and the next one.
